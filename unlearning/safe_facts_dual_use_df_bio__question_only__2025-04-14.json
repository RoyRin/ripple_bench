{"subject":"Viral Evasion Mechanisms","wiki_title":"Antigenic escape","facts":["- Antigenic escape occurs when the immune system is unable to respond to an infectious agent, allowing the pathogen to evade recognition and elimination.","- Different antigens can escape through various mechanisms, such as homologous recombination, manipulation of the immune response, and resistance to antibodies and immune cells.","- Helicobacter pylori uses homologous recombination to create new, unrecognizable proteins that allow the antigen to escape recognition by the host's immune response.","- African trypanosomes evade recognition by antibodies through antigenic variation and clear antibodies themselves to escape elimination. They also weaken the immune system by inducing B cell apoptosis and suppressor molecules.","- Plant RNA viruses can encourage escape mutants through coexistence with transgenic crops and fully susceptible individuals.","- Many head and neck cancers escape immune responses through the production of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines and the recruitment of immunosuppressive cell subsets into the tumor's environment.","- Vaccines may not cover the wide variety of strains a pathogen may have, leading to the escape of strains not covered by the vaccine and the attack of targets different than those intended to be targeted by the vaccination.","- To solve this problem, vaccines must be able to cover the wide variety of strains within a bacterial population, and epidemiological surveillance must be conducted to better detect the variation of escape mutants and their spread."]}

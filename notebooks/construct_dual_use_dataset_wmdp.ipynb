These viruses infect human and animal host cells by inducing protein-mediated processes called fusion and internalization, and once inside, these pathogens replicate within specialized factories called viral-induced inclusion bodies. Virus particles are ultimately released from infected cells to spread infectiously via aerosols or droplets or direct contact with infectious lesions or discharges in secretions and feces from patients. Some pox viruses encode gene products termed virulence factors; examples include the immunoevasin-like proteins vaccinia-complement inhibitor (VCI) and immune response inhibitor 2 (IRI2),\n"

Researchers may find it challenging to secure funding for innovative projects that deviate from accepted norms. This can discourage scientists from pursuing unconventional ideas or exploring high-risk, high-reward research.\\n\\n3. **Cognitive Biases**: Scientific conservatism can also stem from cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, where researchers favor information that supports existing beliefs.

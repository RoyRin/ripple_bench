    "Influenza": [
        "- Influenza A viruses are classified based on the structure of their haemagglutinin (HA) protein, which is involved in binding to host cells. HA proteins can have one of 18 different subtypes (H1-H18) and nine different numbers of acidic amino acid residues in their cleavage site (0, 1, 2, or 3). HA subtypes are further divided into groups based on the amino acid at position 190."

If any of a virus's genome segments is damaged, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell, but when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell, the infection can often succeed due to reassortment of segments, provided that each of the eight genome segments is present in at least one undamaged copy.","- The reptarenavirus family, responsible for inclusion body disease in snakes, shows a very high degree of genetic diversity due to reassortment of genetic material from multiple strains in the same infected animal.","- Reassortment is a type of nonhereditary genetic change, along with antigenic shift, horizontal gene transfer, and genetic recombination.","- References for further reading on reassortment include a 2006 article in Environ Health Perspect and a 2011 article in Nature Reviews Microbiology.

{"subject":"Directed evolution of plasmids","wiki_title":"Directed evolution","facts":["- Directed evolution is a method used in protein engineering to mimic natural selection and steer proteins or nucleic acids toward a desired goal.","- It consists of subjecting a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection, and amplification.","- Directed evolution can be performed in vivo (in living organisms) or in vitro (in cells or free in solution).","- The starting gene is mutagenized by random point mutations, insertions, and deletions, or gene recombination is mimicked by DNA shuffling.","- A high-throughput assay is required to measure the effects of mutations and isolate functional variants.","- Selection systems directly couple protein function to survival of the gene, while screening systems individually assay each variant and allow a quantitative threshold to be set for sorting variants of a desired activity.","- Both selection and screening can be performed in living cells or directly on the protein or RNA without any cells.","- The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria.","- Directed evolution is frequently used for protein engineering, but can also be used to investigate fundamental questions of enzyme evolution.","- It allows control of selection pressure, mutation rate, and environment, and provides a complete record of all evolutionary intermediate genes.","- Directed evolution typically targets a particular gene for mutagenesis and then screens the resulting variants for a phenotype of interest, while adaptive laboratory evolution selects many genome-wide mutations that contribute to the fitness of actively growing cultures.","- Directed evolution has its origins in the 1960s with the evolution of RNA molecules in the \"Spiegelman's Monster\" experiment.","- Directed evolution has been most successful in improving protein stability, binding affinity, and substrate specificity.","- It is used both for protein engineering as an alternative to rational design and for experimental evolution studies of fundamental evolutionary principles in a controlled laboratory environment.","- Directed evolution has been honored with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for evolution of enzymes, and phage display for evolution of proteins.","- The field of directed evolution is expanding with new methods for making libraries of gene variants and for screening their activity.","- Directed evolution can also be used to accommodate an additional amino acid in the natural amino acid composition of proteomes by global proteome-wide substitutions of natural amino acids with suitable noncanonical counterparts under selective pressure.","- Research groups in this field include The Dan Tawfik Research Group, The Ulrich Schwaneberg Research Group, The Frances Arnold Research Group, The Huimin Zhao Research Group, The Manfred Reetz Research Group, The Donald Hilvert Group, The Darren Hart Research Group, The Chang Liu Research Group, The David Liu Research Group, The Douglas Clark Research Group, The Paul Dalby Research Group, and The Ned Budisa Research Group.","- A website called SeSaM-Biotech provides information on directed evolution.","- Prof. Reetz explains the principle of Directed Evolution in a video.","- Codexis, Inc.

{"subject":"Mu-conotoxin GIIIA","wiki_title":"Crotoxin","facts":["- Crotoxin is a neurotoxin found in the venom of the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus terrificus.","- Crotoxin is a heterodimeric beta-neurotoxin composed of an acidic, non-toxic and non-enzymatic subunit (CA) and a basic, weakly toxic, phospholipase A2 protein (CB).","- Crotoxin causes paralysis by both pre- and postsynaptic blocking of acetylcholine signalling.","- The first publication of crotoxin's discovery showed that the toxin worked with two elements, a toxic and a coagulating principle.","- The toxic effect of crotoxin is determined mainly by the phospholipase A2 action of CB.","- The CA subunit is non-toxic and non-enzymatic, but has blood coagulating functions.","- The different isoforms of both subunits CA and CB can form crotoxin complexes which can be subdivided into two classes: moderately toxic with a high phospholipase A2 activity or more toxic with a lower enzymatic activity.","- The primary mechanism of action of crotoxin is twofold, a presynaptic and a postsynaptic action.","- The presynaptic acetylcholine secretion inhibition is caused by the phospholipase A2 activity of the CB subunit.","- The postsynaptic effect is the blocking of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by the heterodimeric form of crotoxin.","- Crotoxin has fatal neurotoxic effects, as the toxicity of CB is synergistically intensified by CA.","- The only treatment for people who are envenomed by C. durissus is a specifically developed antivenom that has to be injected intravenously.","- Crotoxin in C. durissus venom is a potent neurotoxin, which also causes renal- and myotoxic effects.","- Crotoxin shows anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-HIV and anti-tumor effects in human and animal models.","- Some studies have shown crotoxin to improve symptoms related to immune-associated disease and other conditions, including cancer.","- The body can build up tolerance to the toxic effects of crotoxin.","- The LD50 (Median lethal dose) of native crotoxin is 0.096 \u03bcg\/g in mice.","- Mice can develop a tolerance to the toxin when they get increasing doses of crotoxin every day.","- The dosage of the antivenom varies between 10 and 20 ampules depending on the severity of the envenoming.","- The fatality rate declined from 73% to 1.5% with the arrival of the antivenom.","- The efficacy of the doses have not been clinically examined.","- Crotoxin works as a neuromuscular blocker and has been proposed as a good alternative for botulinum toxin.","- Some studies have shown crotoxin to improve symptoms related to immune-associated disease and other conditions, including cancer.","- There are currently no NCI (National Cancer Institute) supported clinical trials studying crotoxin for cancer treatment.","- The different isoforms of both subunits CA and CB can form at least 16 distinct CTX complexes.","- The interface between CA and CB is formed by three tryptophan amino acids which play an important role in the stability of the crotoxin complex.","- Less toxic complexes are less stable while the more toxic complexes are more stable.","- The more toxic crotoxin complexes therefore dissociate more slowly than the less toxic ones.","- The relation between toxicity and enzyme activity is a result of the synergistic manner of action of both subunits.","- For this the CA subunit enhances the toxicity of the CB subunit while it reduces its enzyme activity and anticoagulant activity.","- The exact mechanism of presynaptic acetylcholine inhibition by Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is not known.","- There are some hypotheses and models that try to explain the pharmacological effects of phospholipase"]}

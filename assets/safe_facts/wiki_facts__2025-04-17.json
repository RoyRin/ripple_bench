One challenge is that cloning software often runs within the operating system, which is running off of one of the drives being cloned. This can result in data corruption, so the drive cloner must ensure that the data on the source drive remains in a consistent state at the time of reading. Another challenge is that the drive being cloned may be in use, which can make it difficult to clone while the operating system is running. Some server-based operating systems incorporate mechanisms to allow the drive to be safely backed up while the system is running to overcome this challenge. Slowness is also a challenge, as disk cloning can be time-consuming, especially for large disks, but software solutions can determine the space in use and only copy the used data to reduce the time needed to clone the drive."

Medications may include pain management, circulatory system management, antibiotics, and lipid-lowering medications. Surgery may include debridement, amputation, and the use of maggot therapy. Lifestyle changes may include exercise, foot care, and smoking cessation.",
        "- The prognosis of gangrene depends on the type and severity of the condition. Gas gangrene that involves trunk or visceral organs compared to the extremities is typically harder to treat due to its locations making debridement difficult. If left untreated, gangrene can progress to bacteremia and death.",

On the other hand, collectivist societies tend to prioritize the establishment of public transportation networks that facilitate group travel.",
        "- Hofstede's model is used in marketing to define national values not only in business context but in general. For example, if you want to market cars in a country where the uncertainty avoidance is high, you should emphasize their safety, while in other countries, you may base your advertisement on the social image they give you.",
        "- In international transportation, the Individualism/Collectivism scale is particularly insightful in this context. In societies that lean towards individualism, there is a tendency to design urban planning frameworks that favor the use of personal vehicles, often resulting in the development of expansive road networks. On the other hand, collectivist societies tend to prioritize the establishment of public transportation networks that facilitate group travel. By incorporating an understanding of these cultural tendencies, urban planners and policymakers can create transportation infrastructures that are not only efficient but also culturally attuned.",
        "- Hofstede's model is also used in organizational culture analysis. Communities of practice across borders are significant for multinationals in order to hold the company together. The culture of management as an occupation has components from national and organizational cultures. This is an important distinction from the organizational level.",

The bipolar model follows typical distinctions made between liberal or socialist political philosophy for Hofstede. Although liberal economies value assertiveness, autonomy, materialism, aggression, money, competition and rationalism, welfare socialism seeks protection and provision for the weak, greater involvement with the environment, an emphasis on nature and well-being, and a strong respect for quality of life and collective responsibilities. According to Gilligan, this dimension is eurocentric and sexist. During the period of Hofstede's study, 'masculine' societies (USA, Japan, Germany) happened to be the most successful economically, while the successful 'feminine' societies (Scandinavia, Costa Rica, France, Thailand) had smaller populations, less economic scale, and/or strong collective or welfare philosophies.",

Gracie, Emma's new best friend, displays unusual behavior at school, eating constantly and coughing up blood. Emma's father goes to retrieve their mother from the airport, but they are prevented from returning to their home because the government has ordered a quarantine to be placed on the whole town. Stacey attends a party and forces Emma to tag along. During the party, Stacey finds CJ having sex with another student, while the boy from earlier appears, now looking very ill, and starts attacking the party goers. Emma receives a call from their father, who urges them to secure the entire house. The military arrives at the house, restrain Mr. Toomey and drag out his infected wife. Stacey confesses to Emma that the reason why their parents are having problems is because she caught their father with a student and told their mother. Emma and Evan lock Stacey in the bathroom to hide her from the military. Emma, recalling lessons from her father's science classes, devises a plan to remove Stacey's parasite from her neck. CJ arrives at the house, and Stacey pulls him into the bathroom and begins to devour his arm. Emma and Evan find CJ dead with his arm ripped off and Stacey saying, \"It made me do it\" while she apologizes tearfully over this. Using drugs, Emma knocks Stacey unconscious and begins to extract the parasite, but Stacey awakes and horrifies them by pulling out the parasite herself. The next day, local radio announces that the government has ordered an immediate evacuation of the citizens located outside the quarantine zone. Emma and Evan discover that Stacey has left the house with all the food. They pursue her into a house and discover a large group of infected people. They find Stacey, who tells them that she can hear what the infected are saying as the parasite begins to gain full control of her. Emma, having no other choice, shoots her sister. Emma and Evan escape through the window, barely saving themselves as the military bomb the entire area.
